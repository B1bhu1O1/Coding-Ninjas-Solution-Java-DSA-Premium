/*
Given two integers a and b. You need to find and return the count of possible ways in which we can represent the number a as the sum of unique integers raise to the power b.
For example: if a = 10 and b = 2, only way to represent 10 as sum of unique integers raised to power 2 is-
10 = 1^2 + 3^2 
Hence, answer is 1.
Note : x^y represents x raise to the power y
Input Format:
The first line of input contains two space separated integers, that denote the value of a and b.
Output Format:
The first and only line of output contains count of ways in which a can be represented as sum of unique integers raised to power b.
Constraints :
1 <= a <= 10^4
1 < b <= 20
Time Limit: 1 second
Sample Input 1 :
10 2
Sample Output 1 :
1
Sample Input 2 :
100 2
Sample Output 2 :
3
Explanation:
Following are the three ways: 
1. 100 = 10^2
2. 100 = 8^2 + 6^2
3. 100 = 7^2+5^2+4^2+3^2+1^2
